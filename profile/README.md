# Building the Energy Autopilot for Industry
We’re building a **real-time energy brain** — a platform that connects control systems, forecasting models, and energy markets into one continuous feedback loop.
Think of it as autopilot for industrial energy: smart, reactive, and always learning.

## Under the hood
We’re powered by:
- **Go** for backend services, edge logic, and event pipelines
- **Python** for forecasting, optimisation, and AI/LLM workloads
- **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **RabbitMQ** for data and messaging
- **Terraform**, **ECS**, and **AWS** for infrastructure and automation

We build systems that are alive — observant, adaptive, and autonomous — yet always explainable.

Our north star: make industrial energy systems so smart they run themselves (and make the grid a little cooler in the process).
